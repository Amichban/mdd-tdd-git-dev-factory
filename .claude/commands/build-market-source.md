description: Configure a market data source with guided setup, progress tracking, and status updates.
---

Use the market-data-source-builder skill to help the user configure a market data source.

Start by asking which provider they want to set up (Oanda, Interactive Brokers, Alpaca, Binance, etc.) and guide them through the complete configuration process with:

1. Progress indicators at each step
2. Real-time status updates
3. Clear explanations of requirements
4. Connection testing and validation
5. Troubleshooting for any issues

If the user mentions a specific provider or has an error, start from the appropriate phase.
