# Start New Idea Refinement

Invoke the Domain Expert skill to transform your idea into structured specifications.

## Instructions

Use the `domain-expert` skill to guide you through:
1. Understanding the problem
2. Identifying personas
3. Creating user stories with acceptance criteria
4. Extracting preliminary entities

## Process

Start by asking the user about their idea:

"Let's transform your idea into structured specifications. Tell me about the problem you're trying to solve - who experiences it, what the pain point is, and what success would look like."

Then follow the domain-expert skill process to:
- Ask clarifying questions one at a time
- Identify all personas
- Extract user stories with Given/When/Then acceptance criteria
- Identify preliminary entities
- Create GitHub Issues for each user story

## Output

Generate:
1. A specification document with all personas and user stories
2. GitHub Issues for tracking (one per user story)
3. A summary of preliminary entities for the ontology expert
